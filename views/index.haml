              :smartypants
                Almost three years ago today I discovered that my father had cancer, three months later, he died.
                His body was riddled with the disease, it was painful emotionally and physically. This month my aim is to raise as much money as possible.

              :smartypants
                You can raise money and awareness of prostate cancer by growing a moustache during the month of november. If you'd rather leave the embaressment to someone else, throw some dimes down and support a fight worth fighting for.
