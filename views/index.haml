              %p Almost three years ago today I discovered that my father had cancer, three months later, he died.
              %p His body was riddled with the disease, it was painful emotionally and physically. This month my aim is to raise at least a few hundred dollars for movember.

              %h2 Movember?
              %p You can raise money and awareness of prostate cancer by growing a moustache during the month of november. If you'd rather leave the embaressment to someone else, throw some dimes down and support a fight worth fighting for.
